# Pollution Increases
With pollution driving many aspects of the Factorio biter AI, sevveral changes are available and enabled by deault with the intention of making pollution harder to control and dependent more on progression and base size (think of it more as a "base score" rather than pollution).

It also makes desert and forest areas more equal in difficulty.

   * Trees dont continously absorb pollution.
   * All tiles/chunks absorb pollution at the same rate as normal sand (desert) tiles.
   * Efficency modules increase pollution to offset the energy savings.
   * Solar generates pollution. Biters will no longer ignore large solar arrays destroying fields and forests in their construction.
   
# Aggressive Biter Expansion
Biters will now be far more aggressive in building forward attack bases in areas near your base.
This scales with evolution and pollution, with some attack bases potentially being far nearer than normal.
